# Food Picker

v0.1: Simple script that takes in user input from command line and returns a list of nearby restaurants from Uber Eats along with link to each restaurant page.

## To-Do Next Update:
  - Use WaitUntil instead of sleep()
  - Add filters for cuisine type and walking time
  - Select random restaurant from list
  - Open selected restaurant page
  
## In the Future:
  - Select random menu item from page
  - Add filter for price
  - Create some sort of registry for past selections to avoid repeat orders
  - Create a GUI interface
